      The Hawa Mahal is a palace in the city of Jaipur, India.
       Built from red and pink sandstone, it is on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. 
       The structure was built in 1799 by the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, the founder of the city of Jaipur, India.
        He was so inspired by the unique structure of Khetri Mahal that he built this grand and historical palace. 
        It was designed by Lal Chand Ustad. Its five-floor exterior is akin to a honeycomb with its 953 small windows called Jharokhas decorated with intricate latticework. 
        The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen.
         This architectural feature also allowed cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through, thus making the whole area more pleasant during the high temperatures in summer.
          Many people see the Hawa Mahal from the street view and think it is the front of the palace, but it is the back. </p> </div> </center>

                <p>I watched it 6 months ago and I loved it!
                  You should have a minimal understanding of the astras in indian mythology and the hype ayan mukherji creaated, or you will miss 30% of the fun.
                   You should read about the basic plot of the film before watching Avengers: Endgame.
                    The movie is onw of the only bollywood films which doesn't condemn (and infact promotes!) our ancient history.
                    You will enjoy it a lot.
                     Shah Rukh Khan has the (spoiler alert) Vanarastra and has a cool cameo scene which provides a great headstart to the storyline.
                     Throughout the film, you can find EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE VFX. The astras look so realistic and have so much detail, similar to even Hollywood films!
                     The movie is based on the astras from ancient indian mythology, but its plot takes place in modern india, so there is also a love story and it also encompasses new elements of society.
                     The movie shows how shiva falls in love with isha, how he learns about his past and his powers, how the brahmansh assembles and how they fight together to ave the universe from dev's evil powers.
                      The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.</p></div></div>

                              <p>I took watched this movie on Netflix and I loved it!
                                 The story shows how a college student called Ranchoddas, goes to an engineering college and becomes friends with Raju and Farhan.
                                  He was a complete backbencher, but he stil got good grades.
                                   He didn't care about marks, he only cared about learning. 
                                   He helped his friends follow their dreams and also stop being scared of life. 
                                   He was totally extraordinary, he wasn't mean to anyone, but, he didn't let anyone hurt his friends.
                                    Raju later started believing in memorising and changed rooms to be with Chatur, but later he realises how big of a mistake he made.
                                     Rancho falls in love with his school's infamous headmaster "Virus"'s daughter. He later fixes his relations with Virus.
                                      Everyone's lives turn out good at the end, 10 years later, thanks to his advice.
                                  This movie is worth a watch for its deep meaning and explanation of the sad truth faced by engineering students.
                                   The music was also great.
                                    Shaan really brought the film to life but the show stealer was definitely Sonu Nigam.
                                     Students would love it.</p></div></div>
